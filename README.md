# Partial Difficult

The goal of this project was to introduce a method of testing motility values calculated using a set of partial differential equations that predict the path of a deer with Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) over various landscapes. The combination of Cellular Automata and Perlin Noise allows for pseudo-random, but repeatable terrain to be created, that allow a list of calculated motility values to be simulated by our silicon friends.
